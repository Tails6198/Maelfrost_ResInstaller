# Hi

This is a simple system resource patcher for Maelfrost that will run as part of the OOB phase.


# Ok but is it done?

It's not and will not be for a while. In fact, it might never be done. Depends if I run into roadblocks.


# Can I help?

Pull requests are welcome, even if they're typo fixes. 


# Wtf I hate C#

That wasn't a question, but same
