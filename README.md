# Hi

This is a repository for the Maelfrost installer, which will patch a base ISO of Windows 11 to become Project Maelfrost.

In order to build the code here, you're going to need Visual Studio 2022, .NET 6 and some other nonsense I forgot about while writing this readme. Just install everything.


# Ok but is it done?

It's not and will not be for a while. In fact, it might never be done. Depends if I run into roadblocks.


# Can I help?

Pull requests are welcome, even if they're typo fixes. 


# Wtf I hate C#

That wasn't a question, but same
